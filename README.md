# Hydra_adex_LIFrealistic_net

These are two models of the neural networks. 

First is a 100-neuron network model of collective bursting activity of a hydra endodermal net. The activity is essentially controlled by
single neuron bursting currents. Activity does not go to the syncronisation due to single neuron adaptation.

The second 676-neuron network is a model of a signal propagation in the realistic hydra-like connectivity. The network topology in this
case allows to have multiple types of activity, including activity reverberations, signal propagation and signal multiplexing.
